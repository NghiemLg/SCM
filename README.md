# Supply Chain Analysis Notebook

## Overview
This Jupyter Notebook, titled `supply-chain-analysis.ipynb`, focuses on analyzing various aspects of supply chain management. It includes data processing, modeling, and visualization steps aimed at understanding and optimizing supply chain operations. The notebook provides tools and insights to improve efficiency, reduce costs, and streamline processes across the supply chain.

## Features
- **Data Loading and Cleaning**: Import and preprocess raw supply chain data for analysis.
- **Descriptive Analytics**: Summarize key metrics and provide visualizations to highlight trends and patterns.
- **Predictive Modeling**: Apply machine learning models to forecast demand, inventory levels, and other critical factors.
- **Optimization Techniques**: Demonstrate techniques for optimizing supply chain logistics, such as route optimization and inventory management.
- **Visualization**: Use plots and graphs to provide insights into supply chain performance.

## Requirements
Ensure the following dependencies are installed to run the notebook:

- Python 3.8 or later
- Libraries:
  - pandas
  - numpy
  - matplotlib
  - seaborn
  - scikit-learn
  - scipy
  - jupyter

You can install these libraries using the following command:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn scipy jupyter
```

## How to Use
1. Open the Jupyter Notebook using the command:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook supply-chain-analysis.ipynb
   ```
2. Follow the step-by-step instructions provided in each cell to execute the analysis.
3. Customize the analysis by replacing the sample data with your own supply chain datasets.
4. Adjust parameters in the models and optimization techniques to suit your specific use case.

## Dataset
This notebook assumes the presence of a dataset containing the following columns (as an example):
- `Product_ID`
- `Warehouse_Location`
- `Stock_Level`
- `Demand`
- `Lead_Time`
- `Shipping_Cost`

You may need to adapt the notebook to match your dataset structure.

## Outputs
The notebook generates the following outputs:
- Descriptive statistics and summary tables.
- Forecasted demand and inventory levels.
- Optimized routes and resource allocation.
- Visualizations such as time-series plots, bar charts, and heatmaps.

## Customization
Feel free to modify the code to:
- Include additional data columns.
- Use other machine learning models or optimization algorithms.
- Enhance visualizations for better storytelling.
